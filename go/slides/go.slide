* Some more cool features

Go is a new programming language (2009) that didnâ€™t evolve or borrow from existing programming languages such as C# and Java. 

Go focuses on real-world practices for building next-generation applications on the cloud as well as distributed and concurrent computing environments, and for system programming.

Is a statically typed (the type of a variable is known at compile time), garbage-collected, natively compiled programming language that mostly belongs to the C family.

Highly pragmatic maybe for some developers, Go refuses to compile programs with unused variables or imports.

* Memory Management
What Goes Where? The Go Programming Language Specification does not define where items will be allocated. 

However, certain requirements will exclude some choices of memory in certain conditions. For instance:

- The size of the data segment cannot change at run time, and therefore cannot be used for data structures that change size.
- Heap (or free store), an area of memory used for dynamic memory allocation.
- Variables allocated in the stack unlike heap allocated, are destroyed when the rest of the stack is destroyed (when the function returns).

* Garbage collection
